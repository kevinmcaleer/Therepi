# TherePi
The Raspberry Pi based Theremin like Musical Instrument, built with two HC-SR04 Range Finders. Its pronouced Thera (as in Therapy), Pie - Thera-Pie.

Software Architecture
TherePi uses Python-OSC, and Sonic Pi on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2, to produce sounds based on the distances read from the two range finders; one for volume, and one for pitch.

Unlike the Theremin, the TherePi can auto-tune to specific notes, making it slightly easier to play.
